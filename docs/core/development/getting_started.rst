Getting started with Twisted development
========================================




Working on Twisted requires the installation of several development dependencies. These are specified in the dev-requirements.txt file. It is recommended that you create a virtual environment dedicated to Twisted development. If not familar see `virtualenv`. All of the dependencies can be installed into your virtual environment using pip.

```shell
$ # Create a virtualenv and activate it prior to the following steps
$ pip install --requirement dev-requirements.txt
```
